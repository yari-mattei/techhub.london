## Getting started

You need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed to run [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).  
I really suggest you to install Node.js with a packet manager, instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).  

- Install Node.js and verify that everything is allright with `node -v`
- Install Grunt-cli with `npm install -g grunt-cli` 
- Fork the project and clone it on your machine
- Install npm modules dependencies with `npm install`
- Install bower dependencies with `bower install`
- Inject bower dependencies directly into the html with `grunt bowerInstall

## Developement
Run `grunt serve` and start editing the pages that you find in `app/` directory.  
It will fire a browser with livereloading feature enabled.  
Happy coding!

## Build
Run `grunt build` to build the project into `dist/`  
Pull request when you are done ;)
